# SuperStores-Sales-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a Superstore to uncover key business insights and trends. Using Microsoft Excel, I performed data cleaning, visualization, and interactive dashboard creation to explore metrics such as sales, profit, category-wise performance, and regional analysis.
